## cs246-projects
These are projects that were made for my cs246 (Object-Oriented Programming) class in the spring of 2020.

These projects are designed to be used with Visual Studio, and were created in the 2019 Community edition.

### Building and running

To build these, press CTRL + SHIFT + B within the Visual Studio environment.  To run, press CTRL + F5 within the Visual Studio environment.
