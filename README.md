# cs246-projects
These are projects that were made for my cs246 (Object-Oriented Programming) class in the spring of 2020.

These projects are designed to be used with Visual Studio, and were created in the 2019 Community edition.

To build these, press CTRL + SHIFT + B within the Visual Studio environment.  To run, press CTRL + F5 within the Visual Studio environment.

Thank you for looking at my work!
